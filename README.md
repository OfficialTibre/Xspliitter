# Xsplitter
APK version of the webui of streaming remote by fredemmott


This is simply the webui from streaming remote but converted into an android app.
I have re-labelled some things inside which may confuse the average user and edited the colours and layout slightly to be a bit more pleasent on the eyes.

I designed this app for ease of use and if you don't wish to install it to your phone
you can download just the source files and and run them in a web browser

this app requires no special permissions or access to your phone but you will have to enable "install from unknown resource" on your phone
